  <!-- 
    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Vulnerability Scanner will be worked on more often than the other
options Settings and Attack/ Record will be worked on aswell I will
be importing the attack options from the older version of SEDT.

Version 1.1 Console Application             (Ark)
Version 2.1 Windows form Application (Legacy)
Version 3.1 Flat UI Variant                        (Voyager)

As some of you are aware Project "Ark" is no longer available for
download on my SF Page It will be updated through Project
"Voyager" and will be kept up to date. also you wont be able to
record info through Voyager for sometime while I ReDesign that
Attack option so I highly Encourage you to download and use 
Legacy for the time being when Voyager is ready to be used I will
post it here for you to see.

+ Updated SEDT...
+ Redesigned Options and Info.

*MAJOR UPDATE*

I am pleased to announce the newest version of SEDT! This
version is a FlatUI Variant, and is more smooth and easier
to navigate. While Im building this version, everything from 
the older SEDT versions will be imported over to this version 
of SEDT.

Please be patient while I build this version it will take time, but
in the meantime it will be available to use. It will be an
**EXPERIMENTAL** **NON-FULLY DEVELOPED** version, so if
you encounter bugs you know why :)

I love you guys for all the help and support! Until next time.


Happy Hunting!

+ Scanner (Tools&gt;Scanner)(In, Development)
+ Command Shell (Console&gt;Command Shell)( Functional)
+ Profiles (Settings&gt;Profiles)(In, Development)
+ Feedback (Settings&gt;Help&gt;Feedback)(Functional)
-  Update (Console Application)(Deprecated)
&gt; Moved Help Option (Contains About/ Update)
&gt; Update (GUI)(Settings&gt;Help&gt;Update)
&gt; About (Settings&gt;Help&gt;About

The added options are not useable so trying to use them will result
in NOTHING happening lol I’ve been thinking about it for a while 
and I’ve decided to bring back the console application of SEDT and 
use it as the command shell.

This means I will be updating Sedt (Console Version) normally from 
now on so the console and GUI versions will receive active updates
also, this means I will be discontinuing the console application page
on my source forge account starting New Years. with that said I will
also, be updating the way Sedt updates and a slew of other things so
until next time.

Happy Hunting!

I have not released many updates or patches since the last
update this one will be a small update i added a "Restart"
feature so if the program becomes buggy or unresponsive
when you get the chance you can restart if that ever 
becomes an issue it is HIGHLY recommended to restart 
after every update.

================================
[05] Exception/Normal.
[00] SUCCESS!
[02] FAILURE!
[01] Unknown Event.
[03] Exception/ Event unknown.
[04] Failure but system completed task.
================================

Severity Codes/Levels
=============================================
[001]  Minor Exception: 	              severity level 10
[002]  Minor/medium Exception: 	  severity level 20-30
[003]  Medium Exception: 	              severity level 40
[004]  Medium/major Exception: 	  severity level 50-60

[009]  Network Problem:		   0 severity level
[010]  Unknown Problem: Requires Debugging

These codes are used to define the exceptions you get 
in the log file if you have trouble finding out what they
mean refer to this information.

[04] you will encounter this error many times it more than
likely will be the most common one this refers to a problem
with programming and it is not on the users side so dont 
worry about it.

[05] this means an exception was caught and the problem
was fixed and not in the slightest of importance its just for
my reference.

*PLEASE READ CAREFULLY*

Today is the first day where i start implementing logging
so i can better debug and find errors related to the program
that is not always displayed keep in mind this logging is
recording what options you use in sedt so if an error rises
then i can find out what option(s) you used leading up to
the error. You will be able to disable this, doing so will
attempt a deletion on startup and exit of the "log.dat" file

I highly encorage to keep the logging enabled so if 
something does happen you can send me the log file and i
can figure out whats going on, or what error occured.

I CANNOT OBTAIN THE LOG FILE ON MY OWN I NEED YOU
TO SEND IT TO ME IF YOU REQUIRE ASSITANCE.

+ logging (Experimental)

+ Logging of updates and any other exceptions or errors

So i've added some advacned options on the main menu

work as of yet im still working on that and testing other
tools such as "Attack, Search, and Lookup" Please be
patient while i work on these problems.

In a couple of weeks im going to be focusing completely 
on the programs listed, so that means no more options will
be added until these programs are either fully functional or
or in experimental that means all of them!

&gt; Verify (Developing/ Functional)
&gt; Search (Developing/ Functional)
&gt; Lookup (Developing/ Functional)
&gt; Database (in Development)
&gt; Geolocation (in Development)
&gt; Integcheck (in Development)

--------------------ADDITIONAL INFO------------------------

Any questions or concerns please dont hesistate to
contact me.

Everything you see that says "in Development" im 
working on as of this moment and they'll be avalible
for you to use but it may not function properly so if
you get a problem with a option just know that im
still working on it. Experimental means you can still
use the program you might encounter bugs so dont
be sad if you do. in Progress , Still Functional Means
you can stil use the program ill just be making minor
changes to it.

If you have any questions or concerns visit my social
media and DM me or Comment on my YouTube
